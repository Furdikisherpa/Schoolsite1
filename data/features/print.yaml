description: "Our elementary school offers focused study in a small classroom format. Core academics include curriculum from various publishers such as Bob Jones University Press, ABeka, and Purposeful Design. The Bible is the cornerstone for all of our teaching. We consider all aspects of a childâ€™s development (spiritual, academic, social, physical) in planning and implementing lessons"
