text: "In this school, I was introduced to a lot of educational, sporting, and recreational opportunities. Besides studies, the teachers and administrators were very encouraging to take part in the extracurricular activities and also made sure that they were fun. It is a close-knit school and I am incredibly grateful for the many life-long friends I made from numerous backgrounds. My class was also one big family by the time we graduated."
