text: "Gyan Jyoti is a prestigious institution that was designed to produce global change makers. It also reminds me of teachers and mentors who pushed me to achieve things that I never felt were in my grasp. Looking back, I feel that even though I might have forgotten the theories and formulas my teachers taught me, I have memories which I will never forget. Life lessons and values that my Gurus have taught me, still heavily defines who I am and what I do till this date. I will be forever grateful to Gyan Jyoti.Thank you!"
