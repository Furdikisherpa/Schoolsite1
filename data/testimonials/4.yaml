text: "Gyan Jyoti is an awesome English school! The Location is very good, the building is kept tidy and the teachers and staff are a high point. I had spent my middle school with Janaki, and she is (besides lovely and super cheerful and positive) an amazing teacher. The administrative part is organized, and Iâ€™ve never had any problems with. They always try to bring activities for the students and encourage them to interact. The nationality mix in the morning period was excellent!"
