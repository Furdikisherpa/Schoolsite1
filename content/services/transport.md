> **Lincoln School provides transportation for students in various sections of Kathmandu and Lalitpur with its fleet of air-conditioned buses and vans.**

Around 85% of students take advantage of this service. Depending on where a student lives, the length of the bus rides will average from 10 minutes to 50 minutes. During the commute, the school is in constant contact with the drivers through the installed 2-way radios and GPS trackers. Bus monitors are employed to assist with the needs of the students during their time on the bus.
