> **The Food Service at Lincoln School aims to provide nutritious lunch and snack options that meet the developmental needs of our students.**

The American Mission Association, Lincoln School’s catering service, provides freshly prepared healthy and balanced vegetarian and non-vegetarian meals that are low in added fats and sugars. Students can opt to order from a daily set menu, which includes a main dish as well as a side of fruits and vegetables, or from the à la carte menu. In addition to these options, which offer a range of international cuisines, secondary students can also order from a restaurant which serves Japanese and Korean food as well as a restaurant that serves Nepali food.
