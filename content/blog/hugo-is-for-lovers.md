Sixty-five talented middle school singers from throughout Asia gathered on Lincoln’s campus for three days of music-making, learning, and friendship in the Association for Music in International School’s Asian Middle School Honor Mixed Choir Festival. Through hours of engaged rehearsal, fun activities, an excursion to Swayambhu, and a fabulous culminating concert, the students had an unparalleled music experience that will last a lifetime. Lincoln students and staff enjoyed a preview of the concert on Friday and then filled the Globe Theatre again on Saturday. Through generous audience donations, Lincoln also funded two future AMIS scholarships. Congratulations to all of our Snow Leopard Singers and our guests from the International School of Hyderabad, International School Bangkok, Canadian International School of Bangalore, American International School Dhaka, American International School Chennai, and American School Bombay. Check out some of our favorite moments here.
