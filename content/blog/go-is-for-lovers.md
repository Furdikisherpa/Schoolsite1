#### Boys’ Basketball Shows Immense Growth During SAISA!

The Lincoln School SAISA Boys’ Basketball team had an amazing season-ending tournament in Mumbai at the American School of Bombay. The season was a great learning experience for a very young team. With only a few students having played organized basketball before, the team started from the ground up and showed immense improvement by the end of the season. They played hard every game and never quit competing, and will be a force to be reckoned with in the years to come.
