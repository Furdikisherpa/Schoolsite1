> **It Starts with Caring Teachers that Love**

Our elementary school offers focused study in a small classroom format. Core academics include curriculum from various publishers such as Bob Jones University Press, ABeka, and Purposeful Design. The Bible is the cornerstone for all of our teaching. We consider all aspects of a childâ€™s development (spiritual, academic, social, physical) in planning and implementing lessons. In addition, our Learning Lab helps equip students with special needs or academic challenges to move towards efficient thinking and independent lifelong learning.

> **Elementary Activities**

Core academics are supplemented with chapel, art, music, Spanish, computers and physical education. Our students also compete in the annual ACSI Speech Meet and Math Olympics competitions.  We also enjoy annual events with our family and friends such as Fall Frenzy, Grandparents Day, Family Fun Night, and Field Day.
