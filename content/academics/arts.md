> **Students at Lincoln School can take advantage of various opportunities outside of the classroom to enhance their interests in the visual and performing arts.**

Performing Arts

In the elementary school, our honor choir and rock band perform both in the school, as well as in the community. There is also a Young People’s Choir of Kathmandu Spring Retreat Weekend where students work with other singers their age from around the city singing songs and building community through music. The After-School Activities (ASAs) for all ages include music providers so that children can receive voice lessons and hone their skills on various musical instruments.

As an active member school of the Association for Music in International Schools (AMIS), Lincoln Middle & High School students are invited to participate in several international events including Honors Choirs, Honors Bands, and Solo & Ensemble Festivals. Zero-hour and after-school multi-age ensembles, such as band, choir, and rock/jazz band, encourage students to progress both independently and with others.

Upper-elementary, middle, and high school students are encouraged to be a part of our theatrical productions, both on and off stage. Our student-led and student-centered musicals and plays allow for singers, dancers, and actors, as well as those interested in stage management, lighting design, sound engineering, direction, or choreography.



> **Outside of our competitive SAISA program, Lincoln offers a wealth of opportunities for students to further develop their skills and understandings in a sporting context. Our year-round Football development program is offered to different age-groups from lower elementary to high school.**

Each SAISA season, students who do not make or tryout for the competitive teams, are still able to progress their skills as part of these youth development programs in Basketball, Football and Volleyball.

Our developmentally-appropriate Aquatics program also showcases this leveled development. Students who are still in the early stroke development phases can join our After School Learn-to-Swim classes. Typically, we have younger students join the Learn-to-Swim sessions (grades 1-5), which take place a minimum of two times per week, including our Saturday Morning Swim School. Beyond this, we offer a Snow Leopards Cubs Swim Club, which is offered to Elementary students who have achieved pink cap or above in our swimming and water safety levels. The focus of this club is technique development with swimmers looking to improve their skills in the four competitive strokes. Students in grades 5-12 are then given the opportunity to tryout for the competitive SAISA teams in Swimming and Track & Field.

> **Elementary After-School Activities**

Elementary students are constantly learning and growing, and our After-School Activities create a space for them to socialize, build, play, and explore. Whether it’s age-appropriate sports instruction, voice lessons, or service learning and leadership engagements, these programs provide young children the opportunity to develop their own independent skills and passions.

With over 90 activities to choose from during the 4 sessions of After-School Activities, Lincoln School has close to 100% participation from the students.

> **Secondary After-School Activities**

From representing a country at a Model UN conference to competing for Lincoln at a SAISA tournament, our after-school program is an opportunity for students to hone their creative and athletic talents. Students can participate in intramural football, develop their piano performance skills, work on-on-one with a teacher to improve their creative writing, or prepare for high school-level competition.
