Our high school programs contain a comprehensive and effective course of study for college preparation. For students with a desire to pursue vocation education, we participate with the KRESA Education for Employment and Education for the Arts programs.

Our high school offers a clear, Christ centered, curriculum. Our academic program features four years of Bible class with a classic liberal arts curriculum taught from a Christian perspective. Our ACSI certified faculty and staff work hard to far exceed state standards and benchmarks as we prepare students for the rigors of college. Our extracurricular activities include trips to the Creation Museum, Ark Encounter, state capitol, participation in History Day competitions, and a vibrant sports program.

View the Multi-Track Graduation Requirements and choose the best track to follow depending upon the studentâ€™s future goals.  You may want to use The Four Year Student Plan Worksheet to plan out the classes the student will need to take each year.

For students with a need for a rigorous program in math, science and computers, we participate in the Kalamazoo Area Math and Science Center. Our students have an excellent record of admission to the college of their choice.
