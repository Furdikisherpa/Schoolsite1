title: "MIDDLE SCHOOL"
---
Our middle school offers quality instruction in a small classroom environment. Our academic program includes curriculum from various publishers such as Big Ideas Learning, ABeka, and Answers in Genesis. Core academics are supplemented with chapel, art, music, Spanish, computers and physical education. The Bible is the foundation for all of our teaching. We consider the needs of a student who is transitioning from a “child” into a young adult when it comes to lesson planning and classroom management. We have high standards for our growing youth while also allowing space to make mistakes. In addition, our Learning Lab helps equip students with special needs or academic challenges to move towards efficient thinking and independent lifelong learning.
