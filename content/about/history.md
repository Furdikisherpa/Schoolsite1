About three decades ago, parents eager to give their children good education in English Medium had to opt for some of the hill stations in India. Before winter started, most such parents and guardians were found heading towards these stations to bring their children home for Winter vacation, and this too, after depositing a lot of money there.

With a view to reducing the flow of Nepalese revenue outside, some farsighted Nepalese citizens came up with a proposal of establishing English medium schools within the country to impart quality education to Nepalese students. In the year 2038 B.S., under the initiative of Mr. Rajesh Khadka, Mr. Gopal Kumar Basnet, Mr. Sudhir Siwakoti and Mr. Dinesh Malla, Little Flowers' English School came into being in the then hamlet of Birtamode in Jhapa with a total number of 47 students and 4 teachers ranging from classes Nursery to Grade II. Now, Little Flowers' English School is a full-fledged Higher Secondary School catering to more than 1800 students and is, perhaps, the only school with all the required infrastructure in the Eastern Development Region.

Inspired by the success of Little Flowers' English School and encouraged by eminent educationists in Kathmandu, Graded English Medium School (GYAN JYOTI HIGH SCHOOL) was established by Mr. Rajesh Khadka, one of the pioneers of LFES, in the year 2041 in a rented house at Sanepa Height in Lalitpur with a total of 78 students, and 18 teachers teaching from Nursery to Grade III. A few years later, the school expanded and was also housed in Kiran Bhawan. As a result of the sense of commitment and untiring effort of the management, the devotion of the staff-teaching or non-teaching and the continued support of guardians, 'GEMS' proudly stands aloft at Dhapakhel in a harmonious educational environment with educational programmes unequalled by other institutions and can proudly boast of having almost all the infrastructure required by an educational institution in level with international standard. The Primary Wing and the Primary hostel are still housed at Kiran Bhawan in Sanepa. At this juncture, it would be totally unfair to ignore the valuable contributions of academic pillars like late Mr. Parsuram Roka, who served in the capacity of Principal for nearly a decade. To him, our salutations !

In an institution like 'GYAN JYOTI HIGH SCHOOL', having a long history, entry and exit of employees is common and unavoidable. However, there are employees who have remained with the institution right since the time of its establishment. We feel grieved to state that many have left for their heavenly abode. May their souls rest in peace. Undoubtedly, their service has been of great value to 'GYAN JYOTI HIGH SCHOOL'. Currently, there are 251 members of teaching, 49 non-teaching, 38 administrative and 138 supporting staff making to a total of 476 employees. Hence, 'GYAN JYOTI HIGH SCHOOL' can rightly claim to be an agent to minimize the problem of unemployment, too.

12 students appeared for the S.L.C. examinations for the first time in 2050 B.S. and, ever since, 100% results with outstanding marks has been a hallmark of 'GYAN JYOTI HIGH SCHOOL'. Till date, a total of 1814 students have graduated from 'GYAN JYOTI HIGH SCHOOL' with 328 achieving distinction, 1224 First Division and the rest Second Division. Master Kundan Nepal was placed Board 6th in 2051 whereas Master Umesh Thapa emerged Board 9th in 2052. Similarly, Master Sugat Ratna Kansakar was placed Board 7th in the year 2059. In the S.L.C. results of 2059, Miss Sunita Yadav was the national topper while Miss Sushila Khadka was third among the girls. 260 students are appearing for the forthcoming S.L.C. Examinations. It also makes us proud to state that 'GYAN JYOTI HIGH SCHOOL' came up with the best results in S.L.C. for two consecutive years, 2058 and 2059 B.S. and was honoured as the best school in the country, and awarded the Birendra National Shield, the National Flag and a cash prize of Rs. 1,00,000/- on both these occasions. Students of 'GYAN JYOTI HIGH SCHOOL' have excelled in academics in the international level, too. To cite some examples, Master Ujjwal Raut, an ex-student of the school was decorated with the Presidential Award in Luther College, Decorah, Iowa, USA for excellent performance in the year 1997. He completed his Ph.D. in Space Science Engineering from Verginia University in 2009 and is currently employed in the same University. Master Pramod Khadka also completed Ph.D. in Economics from George Town University in Washington D.C., USA, in 2009 and is currently teaching at Ajou University in South Korea.
